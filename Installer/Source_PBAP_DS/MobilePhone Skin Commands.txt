MobilePhone RR Plugin Skin Commands
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation instructions
**********************************************************************************************
Pre-requisites:
1) IVT BlueSoleil 5.x or 6.x or 8.x has to be installed. 
For BlueSoleil 5.x,version 5.4.236.0 or greater is required. 
For BlueSoleil 6.x, version 6.4.236.0 or greater is required.
For BlueSoleil 8.x, version 8.0.338.0 or greater is required.

2) This is a .net application so the .net framework must be installed. 2.0 is recommended.


Installing:
Copy all files into a folder C:\Program Files\RideRunner\Plugins\MobilePhone\ (not profile mode)


You need to pair the phone before using this dll. Do this in bluesoleil itself. Once paired it will remain paired forever unless you unpair.

Next, you need the bluetooth address for the phone. Hover over your phone in bluesoleil and you'll see it. 
This needs to be added to your mobilephone.xml file for the dll to allow you to connect only that phone. This is for security reasons.

Test Skin
**********************************************************************************************
This plugin is supplied with a skin for the Carwings_Dynamic_Lite skin. To install this:
Copy all files found into the skin folder into the Carwings_Dynamic_Lite skin folder.


Skinning
**********************************************************************************************
****NOTE*** the onclselclick and onclclick and commands marked with a * only work if the skin file 
starts with mobilephone. This is to stop interaction problems with other plugins.
