'                    SMS,EMS Decoder
'                      2004-9-24
'1.Description
'   This class decode a SMS or EMS PDU code to a certain
'class. You can use it in your software to read SMSs and 
'EMSs. All of this is done under GSM 03.40. I tested it
'on my SIEMENS M55 and NOKIA 8xxx and it works well.
'2.Useage 
'   If you know what type of PDU code, you can create a 
'new instance of class like DIM s as SMS(myPDUCode)
'When instance is created, you read its public variable 
'to get what you want.
'   When TP_DCS=0, PDU code is coded from 7bit 
'charactor (see GSM 03.38), use shared function 
'Deocde7Bit to decode it.
'   When TP_DCS=8, PDU code is coded from Unicode
'charactor (see GSM 03.38), use shared funtion
'DecodeUnicode to decode it.
'3.Bugs
'   So far in my tests I found none.
'4.When you use it
'   You can freely use it or modify it in your program,
'but when you find bugs or improved it please publish it
'or send one copy to me. Thanks
'5.About me
'   I am writting a program which can list folders and 
'files in SIEMENS M55 mobile phone. It can also read
'and send SMS,EMS. Some documents are hard to find on
'internet, but I keep on my mind to study it and finally
'I found it is full of interests.
'    I like freedom, so'I exchange my ideas with all of 
'the world. It is so happy that you can use my classes!
'   In the end, sorry for my poor english.
